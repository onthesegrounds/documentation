#### Legal: Removal registration

A legal filing that registers the removal of an enslaved person from their home state to another state&#x20;

* Usage: Use the Destination property to record the proposed destination for the enslaved person. This event type is particular to states that required enslavers to obtain official authorization for the removal of an enslaved person out of the state. For example, in New Jersey, an enslaver who sought to permanently relocate to another state (or who wanted to sell an enslaved person to a buyer in another state) was legally required to bring the enslaved person in front of two judges for examination. The law stipulated that the enslaved person had to give their consent (and in the case of a minor, parental consent was required) before the judges could issue a removal certificate authorizing the person’s relocation beyond state borders. Note that scholars have documented abuses of the removal registration system by legal officials who participated in the interstate slave trade. Thus, a removal registration event type is meant to document that the enslaver obtained official authorization to take the enslaved person out of the state, but it does not necessarily mean that the enslaved person freely consented to relocation.
